<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::Begin -->

<p>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Ask her how her day was. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid&nbsp;thing.</p>
<!-- Hyde::Excerpt::End -->

<h2>The Luck of the&nbsp;Fryrish</h2>
<p>Say what? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain&nbsp;that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the&nbsp;crew.</li>
<li>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I&nbsp;complain.</li>
<li>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the&nbsp;Hun!</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Leela of Her&nbsp;Own</h2>
<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Bender, we're trying our best. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Who am I making this out to? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?&nbsp;Really?!</p>
<h3>Bender Should Not Be Allowed on&nbsp;TV</h3>
<p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Why would I want to know that? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance&nbsp;money!</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't&nbsp;rock.</li>
<li>I'll get my&nbsp;kit!</li>
<li>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance&nbsp;money!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parasites&nbsp;Lost</h3>
<p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance&nbsp;money!</p>

<p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you ...</p>
