{% excerpt %}

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Ask her how her day was. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

## The Luck of the Fryrish ##

Say what? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

- Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
- Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
- Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Bender, we're trying our best. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Who am I making this out to? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Really?!


### Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV ###

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Why would I want to know that? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!


+ Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
+ I'll get my kit!
+ Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

### Parasites Lost ###

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
